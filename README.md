## Doing Interactive Dataviz Like the Cool Kids
Yeah, I know what you're thinking: How cool can a Javascript library actually be?  
Well, if you've seen an interactive chart at NPR, the New York Times or the Washington Post recently, there's a pretty good chance it was made using [D3](http://d3js.org/). It's all the rage these days!

Bring your computer and let's dive in!
